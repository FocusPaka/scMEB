Description: This package provides a novel and fast method for detecting 
    single-cell DEGs without prior cell clustering results. The proposed 
    method utilizes a small part of known non-DEGs (stably expressed genes) 
    to build a minimum enclosing ball and defines the DEGs based on the 
    distance of a mapped gene to the center of the hypersphere in a feature 
    space. The method on this package is described in the article 'scMEB: 
    A fast and clustering-independent method for detecting differentially 
    expressed genes in single-cell RNA-seq data'.
